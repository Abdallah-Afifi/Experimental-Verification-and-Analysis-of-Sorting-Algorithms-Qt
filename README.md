# How to Use It 

You need to download or clone this repository to your machine, and then run the source files in the Code Directory.

The output will be displayed in Qt, and you can find screenshots of the program on Qt in the repository (Screenshots Directory).

# Algorithms

It has a [Algorithm].md file for each sorting algorithm used in the project for studying reference. The files explain the concept of the sorting algorithm. 

It has a Time Complexity.md file for studying reference. This file explains the concept of time complexity. 

It has a Mathematical Models.md file for studying reference. This file lists the mathematical model for each sorting algorithm. 

It has a Algorithms Implementations.cpp file for studying reference. This file shows how to implement all the sorting algorithms in C++. 

# Analysis Results Graphs

It has a [Algorithm].png file for each sorting algorithm used in the project, including the outcome graph after the analysis.
